# PatientQRProject
An AR-based client for Android used to retrieve and display data from the server about the medical patient
-------------------------------------------------
This client is part of our collaborative project in SpBSUT to assist medical personnel. The client side uses Unity as a basis for an app itself, Vuforia is used for augmented reality features and ZXing.NET is used for recognition of QR-codes. The server is based on Django framework which uses SQLite for database and Django-QR-code for generation of, well, QR-codes. 
You can find the server side here: https://github.com/telf01/medus-server
In order to run the project, you will need to get Vuforia developer licence on their site and copy your key into Vuforia settings.
